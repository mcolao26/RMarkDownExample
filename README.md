# Time Series Modeling for Business 

An R Markdown file and an HTML file showcasing my first uses of R. 
 - Shows how to create a dataframe
 - Has simple functions such as ncol and head
 - Uses the 'Crickets' dataset from the tidyverse library to make a simple scatter plot of chirp rate by temperature.
